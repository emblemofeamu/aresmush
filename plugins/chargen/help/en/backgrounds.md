# Prologues

Prologues let you specify your character's backstory. We are not looking for a novel, just a couple paragraphs covering things like:

* Who is your character?
* Why are they here?
* Anything noteworthy about your character

When typing up your background in-client, please use %%r to separate paragraphs.

`prologue/set <prologue>` - Sets your prologue. 
`prologue` - Views your prologue.
`prologue/edit` - Grabs the existing prologue text into your input buffer.
                (See [Edit Feature](/help/edit)).

Once your character has been approved, you will no longer be able to edit your prologue.  Contact staff if you need to make changes after approval.
