# Demographics

Demographics commands are used to set your character's basic physical information, such as their hair and eye color.

`demographics` - Input this to generate a list of available demographics.

To set a demographic in your MU client, input the demographic followed by the option you want to set. For example, `eyes violet` will set your character's eyes to Violet.

You can learn more about demographics in the [Demographics and Groups Tutorial](/help/demographics_tutorial).
