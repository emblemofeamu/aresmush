# Groups

During chargen, you can assign your character to groups of affiliation.

`groups` - Input this for a list of all group inputs.
`group <input>` - Input this for a list of options available for a group type.

`group/set <input>=<option>` - Sets your option for a group type.

Emblem of Ea has two groups: Faith and Region. In your MU client, you can input `group faith` or `group region` to see the relevant lists. 

You can set your character's Faith with `group/set Faith=<option>`, and you can set your character's Region with `group/set Region=<option>`.

You can more about groups in the [Demographics and Groups Tutorial](/help/demographics_tutorial).
