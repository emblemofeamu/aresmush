# Character Profile Commands

Each character has a character profile that shows character-specific information, such as the region theyâ€™re from, their faith, and more. Profiles can be accessed in both the MU client and the web portal. Web portal profiles have images and other extras that are not served in the MU client.

> Learn about character profiles in the [Profiles Tutorial](/help/profiles_tutorial).

# Viewing Profiles

`profile`: Views your profile.
`profile <name>`: Views someone else's profile.

> **Note:** Any IC information is provided for OOC reference; do not use it inappropriately if you have no IC reason to know it.

# Managing Your Profile

You can customize your web portal profile with custom profile fields. (AresMUSH does not display custom profile fields in-client.)

`profile/add <input>=<description>`: Adds or updates a custom profile input and describes the input.
`profile/delete <input>`: Deletes a custom profile input.
`profile/edit <input>`: Snags the input into your buffer, if your client allows. (see Editing (playtest.emblemofeamush.net/help/edit))
