# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Languages

Your choice of ancestry, the region you come from, and possibly your character class, offer you a set of starting languages. You can choose a number of additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier. Languages on Emblem of Ea come in three types:

* **Common**: These languages are widely spoken across Ea, and your character might have learned any of these languages anywhere.
* **Uncommon**: These languages are not widely spoken on Ea. They are either confined to a specific region, or they are used by scholars and planar denizens. Starting characters may know one or two of these, but be sure to explain in your prologue how you came by this language.
* **Secret**: These languages are carefully guarded, or their knowledge is lost to time. You cannot select these languages in chargen, and learning one will be the result of effort and RP on your part.

## Commands

`cg/review`: Lists the number of languages you can assign.
`sheet`: Shows your character sheet.

`lang/set <lang>`: Chooses an extra language.
`lang/unset <lang>`: Deletes a language from your sheet. You cannot delete languages granted by your ancestry, background, and character class selections.
`lang/info <input>`: Shows one of the language lists. <input> can be `common`, `uncommon`, or `secret`.
