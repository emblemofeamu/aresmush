# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Feats

Now that you have locked your skills and selected your languages, itâ€™s time to choose your feats. Feats in Pathfinder are special abilities that are tied to a character's development and offer customization of a character's abilities. Your choice of ancestry, heritage, character class, and background will have offered you a set of base feats.

## Commands

`cg/review`: Lists the number of feats and feat types that you can assign.
`sheet`: Shows your character sheet.

`feat <name>`: Lists the details of a feat.
`feat/info`: Shows the details of all feats that you have so far. Be aware that this command paginates, there may be more than one page!
`cg/feat <input>=<feat>`: Sets an open feat. Input can be `ancestry`, `archetype`, `charclass`, `dedication`, `general`, `skill`, `special`

It is not possible to unset a feat at this time.
