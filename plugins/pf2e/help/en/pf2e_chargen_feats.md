# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Feats

Now that you have locked your skills, choose your open feats. Feats in Pathfinder are special abilities that are tied to a character's development and offer customization of a character's abilities. Your choice of ancestry, heritage, character class, and background will have offered you a set of base feats. 

Many feats grant other things. They may grant attacks, daily healing changes, another feat, spells, and more. 

## Commands

`cg/review`: Lists the base feats you have available to you.
`feat <name>`: Lists details of a feat.
`feat/info`: Shows the details of all feats that you have so far. Be aware that this command paginates, there may be more than one page!
`cg/feat <type>=<feat>`: Sets an open feat.
`sheet`: Shows your sheet so far.

It is not possible to unset a feat at this time.
