# Pathfinder 2E - Backgrounds List

This helpfile provides a list of the Backgrounds that a player character can have on Emblem of Ea. Backgrounds typically provide ability boosts, skills, feats, or other special options.

Some Backgrounds provide a Lore skill within a specific category. To reduce the amount of duplication on this list, Backgrounds that give a Lore skill are noted with a Lore skill category in parentheses. The categories are: **Deity**, **City**, **Region**, **Terrain**, **Creature**, **Ancestry**, **General/Profession**, and **Crafting**. To see all Lore skills within those categories, see `help lore`.

To set a Background with an option, you must input the background followed by its option in parentheses. For example, `cg/set background=Blessed (Caracorothan)` sets your character's background to the Blessed background that grants training in the Caracorothan Lore skill, and `cg/set background=Martial Disciple (Acrobatics)` sets your character's background to the Martial Disciple background that grants training in the Acrobatics skill.
