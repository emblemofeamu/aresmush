# Registering Alts

Emblem of Ea staff requires that players register their alts to an email address. This disclosure is visible only to you and to staff. Emblem of Eaâ€™s alt registration is separate from the AresMUSH handles system (https://aresmush.com/handles) and AresCentral.

Each alt must be associated with an email address to be approved for play. You must also provide a code word of your choice. This word may be a word or a phrase, may be of any length, and may include any UTF-8-compatible character. You will need to provide your code word to register another character to the same email address. If you lose your password, staff will ask for your code word if you ever lose it and don't have an AresMUSH Central handle.

# Commands

`register <name or email>=<code word>`: Registers the logged in character to a player. <name> can be the name of an existing character, but to register another alt of the same player, you have to provide the code word for that alt.

NOTE: If you are registering for the first time, <name or email> must be a valid email address.

`alts`: : shows you which characters are registered to you, and your registered email and code word.

You can also change your email address or code word at any time with the following commands:

email <new email>: Changes your email for all registered alts.
codeword <new code word>: Changes your code word for all registered alts.
