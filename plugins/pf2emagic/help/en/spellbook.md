# Spellbooks and Repertoires in PF2e

The spellbook command allows you to see which spells you have in your spellbook for a particular class, and optionally, for a particular level.

`spellbook [character]`: See a list of spellbooks available to view.
`spellbook [<character>=]<class>[/<level>]`: View the spellbook for that particular caster class and level.

For spontaneous casters, the contents of their repertoires are accessible in `magic`.
