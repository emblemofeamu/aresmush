# Other Magic-Related Commands in Pathfinder Second Edition

`spell <spell name>`: Looks up the details of a spell. It will accept partial matches, but will display details only if there is only one match. 
`magic [<name>]`: Displays details of spell availability by class for `<name>`, or yourself if name is not given. Displays all casting progressions and focus spell lists. Note: This command does not show what you have prepared, only what you have readied - i.e. what you can actually cast before refreshing. 

The `spell/search` command provides a robust search function to help you find spells for your character to learn. See `help spell search` for more information.
